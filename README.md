# Pixl Go Application
I do not take credit for the creativity behind this application, but I followed along with the code from scratch to get it working, and it's something I'd be able to talk about in a conversation!

## Instructions
Assuming that you have Go and gcc installed on your computer, simply clone this repository, navigate into the resulting cloned project, and run the following commands:<br>
```go mod tidy```<br>
```go run -v ./pixl```
